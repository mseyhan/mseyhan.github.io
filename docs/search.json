    "text": "Hi, I’m Murat Seyhan, a data scientist with a passion for the sea. I’ve always believed that life is a blend of structure and flow, much like the balance between my gusto for data and the open sea. Let me introduce myself in a few words.\n\nDATA SCIENCE\nProfessionally, I’m a Data Scientist, where I’ve specialized in discovering patterns in chaos. Essentially it’s really just a fancy way of saying I help make sense of things that seem too big or complicated for our intuition. From predictive analytics to crafting intuitive dashboards, I’ve always sought to make complex data tell a clear story. Along the way, I’ve had the chance to work on projects that transformed raw numbers into actionable insights, gaining valuable experience at organizations like Garanti BBVA and KPMG.\n\n\nFOOTBALL ANALYTICS\nOne of my recent passions is football analytics. Using Python, I dive into match data to uncover insights and create visualizations. I’m working on ways to bring these analyses to a wider audience, bringing together my interest in sports and data.\n\n\nSAILING ADVENTURES\nDuring my university years, I found myself not just studying Economics but working as a sailing instructor, teaching students of all levels—from beginners to competitive racers—how to handle boats and embrace the wind. This role was deeply fulfilling, combining my love for the sport with the joy of teaching. At the same time, I founded a Sailing Club in Marmara University, creating a vibrant community of students who bonded over the wind and waves. Leading such a community of students was a defining experience—teaching and learning from others, both on the water and off.\n\n\nMUSIC & CREATIVITY\nWhen I’m not immersed in data or the sea, I turn to music for a creative outlet. Playing the guitar, performing live, or producing melodies has been a part of my life since 2014. It’s my way of expressing creativity and connecting with others.\nThis is me in a snapshot—someone who finds joy in analyzing data, navigating the seas, creating music, and exploring football through numbers. If any of this resonates, I’d love to connect and share more!"

    "text": "There is an evident statistical regularity hidden in plain sight — one that, when ignored, quietly shapes football narratives, fuels misjudgments, and silently distorts careers: regression to the mean.\nIf you’re a football fan, like me — since the beginning of my childhood — big effect of my grandfather being a fan and serving on the council committee of Beşiktaş JK. And if you’re a football fan, with the pull of confirmation bias, you’re often inclined to validate your team’s decisions, even when they’re performing bad. You see what you hope to see. Or sometimes you’re affected by the crowd’s opinion, and make up stories about the bad performance, usually ends up finding a scapegoat, perfect fit for the situation. And boo him/her, maybe?\nAnd in most football clubs — especially the ones that are not data-driven or digital-native (which is most of them, outside the privileged few) — the decision-making at the management level is often no different from that of the fans. In some contexts, it may even be worse.\nThey, too, seek causality. They crave a clean narrative, and illuminate the ambiguity. But football doesn’t always offer causal clarity. And in that search for meaning, we often miss what’s actually going on: plain old randomness. It shows up looking like form, momentum, or a player in decline — but it’s just luck, really.\nThis post is about that hidden force — how it works, how it deceives us, and how it affects players, coaches, analysts, and fans alike.\nWith a simple simulation, some stats, and a bit of honest thinking about how we judge performances, we’re going to break down how luck often looks like talent or failure. And how regression to the mean offers a much-needed antidote.\nLet’s begin there."

    "text": "First-Half Narratives: “Exceptional!” “Average…” “Bench him!”\nI’ve deliberately hidden these players’ second-half ratings. Before revealing them, I’d like you to think deeply about the following questions:\n\nHow do you think these players performed in the second half?\nWho would you trust going forward?\nWho would you praise or criticize based on just this half-season snapshot?\n\nPause here. Consider carefully before continuing. Make explicit or mental judgments based on the data you’ve seen so far.\nI know—it’s challenging to guess solely from these dots. To help you internalize, let me offer three relatable player narratives corresponding to each of the three groups.\nRight now, you might be thinking something along these lines:\n\n🟢 For the top performers:\n“He’s exceptional! Clearly, a talent we can build around. He’s the future. We should renew his contract, or if we had to sell him, we should expect extreme amounts!”\n\n\n🔵 For the average performers:\n“Solid player, but maybe lacking ambition. We need more exciting talent—someone who clearly makes a difference.”\n\n\n🔴 For the worst performers:\n“He looks lethargic, uninterested. He simply doesn’t have the mental toughness to succeed at this level. Bench him.”\n\nThese reactions are natural to the human mind, yet they might also be premature.\nJust about a second when you scroll down, you might encounter something counter-intuitive for you. Below, you’ll see the same players’ second half performances, too.\n\n\nReveal: Second-Half Performance | When the Curtain Drops — Reality Check\n\n# --- Plot ---\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(13, 7))\nplot_custom_dots(ax, best_fh, perspective='fh', reveal_other_half=True, cmap=cm.Greens, norm=norm)\nplot_custom_dots(ax, worst_fh, perspective='fh', reveal_other_half=True, cmap=cm.Reds, norm=norm)\nplot_custom_dots(ax, avg_fh, perspective='fh', reveal_other_half=True, cmap=cm.Blues, norm=norm)\nax.axhline(fh_mean, linestyle='--', color='gray', linewidth=1.2)\nax.text(2.05, fh_mean + 0.1, f'First Half Mean: {fh_mean:.2f}', color='gray', fontsize=10)\nax.set_title('Regression to the Mean\\n(First Half Perspective), with dots', fontsize=16, weight='bold')\nax.legend(handles=make_legend(best_fh, avg_fh, worst_fh), loc='lower right', fontsize=11)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor better tracking, I prepared the observations in a way that lets you follow the players left to right on the x-axis. For example, you can now trace exactly how each top performer ended up performing in the second half, based on our modest simulation.\nAlso, the legend provides the average change in performance for each group — which is super useful context.\n\n\nTurns Out, the Story Changes…\nWhen we reveal the hidden half, something remarkable happens:\n\n🟢 Top performers generally decline slightly, not catastrophically, but still, you can observe an evident decline. Also, enough to disappoint inflated expectations.\n🔵 Average players mostly remain stable in average rating. But they ended up going both ways.\n🔴 Worst performers notably improve, challenging the assumptions of incompetence or low motivation.\n\nBut most importantly, they distributed almost homogenously. We don’t see three player categories conserved the distinction between them. This image is a visual representation of regression to the mean in action.\nTo make this transition more intuitive and visually obvious, here’s another version of the same dataset — but this time with arrows connecting the two halves.\nEach arrow shows a player’s change from first half (dot origin) to second half (arrowhead):\n\nDirection: indicates movement.\nColor: matches the original grouping (green, blue, red).\nLength: shows how much the performance regressed toward the mean."

    "section": "Regression Check: A Slope That Reveals the Pull",
    "text": "Regression Check: A Slope That Reveals the Pull\nWhile our simulation illustrates how extremes tend to drift toward the average, we can also show it quantitatively via a simple linear regression. If we take each player’s first-half performance as a predictor and plot their second-half performance against it, we can fit a regression line to see how well one half predicts the other.\nSpecifically, if we take each player’s first-half rating as an independent variable (predictor) and second-half rating as the dependent variable (outcome), we typically see a regression slope less than 1. In a perfectly consistent world, the dots would fall on a 45-degree diagonal line — where every extreme performance repeats itself. That diagonal has a slope of 1.\nIn a simple linear regression of; \\[\\text{Second-Half Performance} = \\text{ a } x \\text{ b } x \\text{ First-Half Performance } \\] the coefficient b (the “slope”) tells us how strongly the second-half scores scale with the first-half scores. A slope of 1 would mean that a player 1 point above average in the first half is predicted to be exactly 1 point above average in the second half. In other words, there would be no “pull” back toward the average.\nBut, because of the luck factors, the line we actually get isn’t that steep. It’s flatter. In our simulation, the regression line has a slope less than 1 because we added luck factor to true skill. That number might seem small, but it’s doing something big:\nThat number might seem small, but it’s doing something big:\n\nIt pulls high performers down: If someone was far above average in the first half, the regression line predicts they’ll be closer to average in the second half.\nIt pulls low performers up: If someone struggled early, it suggests they’ll bounce back — also drifting toward the middle.\n\nCheck this plot out:\n\nfig, ax = plot_regression_with_highlighted_groups(df, best_fh, worst_fh, avg_fh)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does that happen? Because football performance — like many things in life — is a mix of skill and randomness. And since randomness is unpredictable, the correlation between the two halves isn’t perfect. The slope reflects that imperfection. The less perfect the link, the more the extremes “shrink” toward the average. That’s regression to the mean in action — visualized."
